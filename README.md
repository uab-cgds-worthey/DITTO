***!!! For research purposes only !!!***

> ***NOTE:***  In a past life, DITTO used a different remote Git management provider, [UAB
> Gitlab](https://gitlab.rc.uab.edu/center-for-computational-genomics-and-data-science/sciops/ditto). It was migrated to
> Github in April 2023, and the Gitlab version has been archived.

DITTO is an explainable neural network that can be helpful for accurate and rapid interpretation of small
genetic variants for pathogenicity using patientâ€™s genotype (VCF) information.

## Using DITTO

DITTO scores for variants can be obtained by the below 3 ways. Webapp and API are for single variant analysis and the
local setup is for batch/bulk variant predictions.

### Webapp

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
DITTO is available for public use at this [website](https://cgds-ditto.streamlit.app).
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

### API

DITTO is not hosted as a public API but one can serve up locally to query DITTO scores. Please follow the instructions
in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/uab-cgds-worthey/DITTO-API).

### Setting up to use locally

> ***NOTE:*** This setup will allow one to annotate a VCF sample and make DITTO predictions. Currently tested only in
> Cheaha (UAB HPC) because of resource limitations to download datasets from OpenCRAVAT.
> Docker versions may need to be explored later to make it useable in Mac and Windows.

#### System Requirements

*Tools:*

- Anaconda3
- OpenCravat-2.4.1
- Git

*Resources:*

- CPU: > 2
- Storage: ~1TB
- RAM: ~25GB for a WGS VCF sample

#### Installation

Requirements:

- DITTO repo from GitHub
- OpenCravat with databases to annotate
- Nextflow >=22.10.7

To fetch DITTO source code, change in to directory of your choice and run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/uab-cgds-worthey/DITTO.git
```

#### Setup OpenCravat (only one-time installation)

Please follow the steps mentioned in [install_openCravat.md](docs/install_openCravat.md).

> ***NOTE:*** Current version of OpenCravat that we're using doesn't support "Spanning or overlapping deletions"
> variants i.e. variants with `*` in `ALT Allele` column. More on these variants

<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
> These will be ignored when running the pipeline.

#### Run DITTO pipeline

Create an environment via conda. Below is an example to install `nextflow`.

- [Anaconda virtual environment](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)

```sh
# create environment. Needed only the first time. Please use the above link if you're not using Mac.
conda create --name ditto-env

conda activate ditto-env

# Install nextflow
conda install bioconda::nextflow
```

Please make a samplesheet with VCF files (incl. path). Please make sure to edit the directory paths as needed and run
the pipeline as shown below.

```sh
nextflow run pipeline.nf \
  --outdir ./data/ \
  -work-dir ./wor_dir \
  --build hg38 -with-report \
  --oc_modules /data/opencravat/modules \
  --sample_sheet .test_data/file_list
```

To run on UAB cheaha, please update the `model.job` file and submit a slurm job using the command below

```sh
sbatch model.job
```

## Reproducing the DITTO model

Detailed instructions on reproducing the model is explained in [build_DITTO.md](docs/build_DITTO.md)
